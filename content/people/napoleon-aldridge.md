\biohead{Napoleon Aldridge}{}{}

Napoleon Aldridge was born on 25 October 1801 in Oxford, Oxfordshire to \bioref{Edward_Henry_Aldridge} and \bioref{Leah_North}\cite{NapoleonAldridgeBirth} and was baptised on 16 April 1802 at St Mary the Virgin (University Church), Oxford by the Rev. E. Coplestone.  He had four siblings:  Judith Aldridge (1794-?), Virginia Aldridge (1796-?), Leah North Aldridge (1798-?), and Edward Henry Aldridge.

He married \bioref{Mary_Ann_Chymist} on 1 April 1832 at St Giles in the Fields, Camden, London \cite{NapoleonAldridgeMarriage}  (he is noted on the certificate as "widower"; however, there is no evident record of a previous marriage) and they had eight children:  Edward Henry Aldridge (1832-1899),  Napoleon Alfred Aldridge (1836-1905), Leah North Aldridge (1837-1912), Virginia Elizabeth Aldridge (1839-1912), William Aldridge (1843-?), Alice Judith Aldridge (1845-?), Alfred Frank Aldridge (1846-?) and \bioref{Catherine_Aldridge}.

In 1851 he was working as the Senior Clerk to the Master of the Queens court in London and they lived at 18 Crouch Hill Road, Islington, Middlesex \cite{NapoleonAldridgeOccupation}.  In 1861 the Census lists him as being the Chief Clerk of the Masters Office, Court of Queens Bench, and also as a farmer, living at Hill Farm, Green Lane, Sutton Common \cite{NapoleonAldridgeResidence}.  He was farming about 90 acres of land, employing 3 men and 2 boys.  Ten years later he had retired.

He died on 1 Aug 1875 at Oakfield House, Sutton, Surrey \cite{NapoleonAldridgeDeath}.
