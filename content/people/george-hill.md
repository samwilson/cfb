\biohead{George Hill}{}{}

George Hill was born in (about) 1772 in	Paulton, Somerset to \bioref{John_Hill} and \bioref{Elizabeth_Annie_Ames}.
He had nine siblings: Simon Hill (1752--1814), Joseph Hill (1755--1782), Thomas Ames Hill (1758--1827), Elizabeth Hill (1760--1781), Hepzibah Hill, Elizabeth Hill (1762--?), Susanna Hill (1765--?), John Hill (1767--1796) and Robert Hill (1775--1839).

He married \bioref{Hannah_Dando} in 1803 in Paulton and they lived at Hill House. They had eleven children:
John Hill (1804--1871), James Dando Hill (1806, died in infancy), Elizabeth Hill (1807--1809, \bioref{Mary_Hill},
Thomas Hill (1810--1813), Susannah James Hill (1815--1845), Anna Maria Hill (1817--1869), Sarah Hill (1822--?),
Thomas Ames Hill (1823--1894), Robert Hill (1825--?) and Sarah Ann Hill (1826--?).

He was a malster and farmer. With the large malthouse on the grounds of Hill House (still standing), George could provide the malted barley for his older brother Thomas Ames Hill who was an innkeeper like their father John. (The Tithe records show that in 1834 his son owned and lived at the Red Lion, passed down to him from this same uncle.)

He died on 5 December 1832 and was buried in Paulton, Somerset.

The following is the inscription on his gravestone in Paulton churchyard:
