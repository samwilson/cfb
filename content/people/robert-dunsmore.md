\biohead{Robert Dunsmore}{}{}

Robert Dunsmore was born on 11 June 1784 in Ayrshire, Scotland to John Dunsmore and Janet Simpson, and baptised on 11 June 1784.  

He married \bioref{Jean_Kirkland}, and they had five children: James Dunsmuir (1805--1832), Marian Dunsmuir (1808--1872), 
Allan Dunsmuir (?--1847), Mary Dunsmore (1810, died in infancy) and \bioref{Jean_Dunsmore}.
In 1808 they were living at Craighouse, Old Cumnock, Ayrshire. \cite{RDunsmore1808}

He was a prominent Coalmaster in Hurlford.

In 1832, Robert's wife Jean, his son James, James' wife Elizabeth and two of their three daughters died within days of each other in a cholera epidemic which swept the area. Robert then took care of his grandson Robert and granddaughter Marian. (This grandson, Robert, later went on to become one of the wealthiest men in British Colombia, and his son James became the Premier of BC and later the Lieutenant-Governor). 

He died on 16 September 1835 in Hurlford, Ayrshire, leaving a large estate; Probate was granted on 12 July 1836.\cite{RDunsmoreWill} Robert left half his estate to son Allan; the remaining portion was divided between daughters Mary, Jean (who married Boyd Gilmour), Marian (who married John Dunsmuir, coalmaster) and his two orphaned grandchildren.  His grave inscription in Riccarton Churchyard reads:
