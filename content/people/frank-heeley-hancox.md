\biohead{Frank Heeley Hancox}{}{}

Frank Heeley Hancox was born in 1870 in Liverpool, Lancashire to \bioref{Harry_Hancox} and \bioref{Maria_Mary_Merrett} \cite{FHHancoxBirth}. He had three brothers, \bioref{Harry_Merrett_Hancox}, \bioref{Charles_Edward_Hancox} and \bioref{Richard_James_Hancox}.

In the 1891 Census, Frank was living with his family at 30 Edge Lane and was a Student of medicine.\cite{FrankHeeleyHancoxResidenceUK}
But in 1892, he is recorded as leaving England for South Africa on the `Grantully Castle' \cite{FHHancoxTravel} and nothing more shows with regard to his medical studies in England.

He married \bioref{Ethel_Chard_Nelson} in South Africa and it is probable that he had a photographic studio known as \emph{Hancox and Wensch}, Rembrandt Studios, 46 du Toits Road, Kimberley, Northern Cape, South Africa. There is a record of a photograph that he took of Cecil Rhodes and 9 directors of the De Beers Co.\ on 2 January 1899, which is held at the National Archives, Kew, London.\cite{FHHancoxPhotos}

He and Ethel had children, the descendents of whom were living in Durban in 2016.\cite{JanKarpinski}

He died in 1909 in South Africa. \cite{FHHancoxDeath}
