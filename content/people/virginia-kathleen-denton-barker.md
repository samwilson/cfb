From 1945--48 she worked with the Secretariat of the Royal Commission on Population. She was offered a place to read medicine at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in the first year that the Hospital admitted women as medical students. However, she did not take up this offer, instead marrying \bioref{Eugenia_Grebenik} on 28 December 1946\cite{VKDBarkerManuscript}. From 1948--60 she was engaged with domestic life and child rearing (Michael, Peter, and Catherine).

On retiring in 1978 she was active in forming the Runnymede Mental Health Association, which provided care for patients discharged from Holloway and for other patients who were living in the Community. She was also President of the RMHA. A new wing for day respite centre was named after her. \cite{VirginiaDocs}.
