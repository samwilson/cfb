Samuel Chymist married three times. His first marriage was to Mary Crush, on 14 March 1799 at St. Botolphs, Bishopsgate, London. They had four children: John Chymist, Samuel Crush Chymist (1805--1864), Susan Mary Chymist (1806--1851) and William Chymist.  At this time he was a farmer. \cite{SChymistMarriage}

He then re-married, to Elizabeth Wallis on 27 June 1811, again at St. Botolph Bishopsgate, London, (when he was noted as being a widower; Elizabeth's sister Mary was a witness) but there was no issue from this marriage.  He was recorded as being a woolcomber at the time.\cite{SChymistMarriage2}.
