\textbf{Recognition Given U Of A By British}

TUCSON May 18

International recognition of the strength of the department of geology at the University of Arizona and of the wealth of field research opportunity in the state has come through the announcement that a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship has been awarded to an English student for specific graduate study at the University of Arizona. President Homer LeRoy Shants of the University indicated today that the selection of the University of Arizona for one of these school places its department on an equal plane with the great centers of study in that field. The fellowship has been awarded to Eric Geoffrey Hancox, a graduate of the University of Liverpool and of the Imperial College of Science, London University.
