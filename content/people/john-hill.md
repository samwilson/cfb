\biohead{John Hill}{}{}

John Hill was born in 1729 in Paulton, Somerset, to Joseph Hill (1700--1749) and Mary, whose family name is unknown (?--1759). He had three siblings: Joseph Hill (1727--1767), Robert Hill (1731--1787), and Elizabeth Hill.

He married Elizabeth Annie Ames in 1751 and they had ten children: Simon Hill (1752--1814), Joseph Hill (1755--1782),
Thomas Ames Hill (1758--1827), Elizabeth Hill (1760--1781), Hepzibah Hill, Elizabeth Hill (1762--?), Susanna Hill (1765--?), John Hill (1767--1796), \bioref{George_Hill}, and Robert Hill (1775--1839).

He was a Coalmaster, and also owned an Inn in Paulton, Somerset and lived at Hill House, Paulton. A description of  Hill House, as written in a Document of land transfer (held by a living family member) reads:\cite{TheHistoryOfHillHouse}

\begin{quotation}
The earliest available deeds of the property refer to the land being bought by John Hill Gentleman of the Parish of Paulton from Robert Jeanes, Yeoman of the Parish of Priston, ``two closes of meadow or pasture Ground adjoining together called the Meads. Containing by estimation two acres be it more or less situate adjoining to a dissenting house commonly called the Baptists. One other close of meadow or pasture Cround above the said Meeting house containing by estimation two acres and a half be it more or less which said closes of Ground are now in the possession of John Gregory as tenant to the said Robert Jeanes.'' Deeds dated the eighteenth day of October in the thirty-fourth year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord George the Second, which is 18 October 1760.
\end{quotation}

In 1767 John Hill bought more land from the descendants of Joseph Padfield and paid twenty-four pounds and ten shillings. In the deeds he is described as an Innkeeper. He improved the dwelling that stood on the site, by building the Georgian house in the front of an existing cottage. The existence of a large malt house on the land made it an attractive proposition. Legend has it that John Wesley preached from the steps of this building in September 1765. Within this building there is evidence that it was used for malting barley; there is a soaking pit next to a well and drain by the old entrance.

John Hill also bought a considerable amount of land in Paulton including Pearce's Stile, adjoining the orchard of Hill House.

Further information about his coal-mining properties are noted in the following documents (held by living family member):

26 February 1779: Transfer of land in Paulton, for coal mining---Deeds signed by John Hill, Elizabeth Palmer and Robert Hill.

25 March 1768: Indenture of Assignment between John Hill of Paulton Innholder and Robert Hill of same, Butcher:

Within this property are: Tools, tackling and things for mining gaining raising and landing the said coals---together with carts, carriages and otherwise to remove take and carry away the same.

Under the lands comprised in the above demesne were valuable veins or beds of coal and they have been worked from a period previous to the year 1768 by a Company of Proprietors called `The Paulton Coal Company' of which all the above named and since their deaths their legal representatives are partners.
The customary mode of mining for coal in Somerset is for parties in the Works to pay to the proprietor or lessor of the land from which the coal is taken an eighth or tenth or some other proportion of the coal.

Joseph Hill under the will of Joseph Hill of 1767 assumed to be entitled to the coal under the lands above mentioned calling himself the Heir at law of John Hill the grantor by the deal of 1697 for the 1000 years next\dots.
