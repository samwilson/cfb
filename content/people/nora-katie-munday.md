Nora was born at 7.45pm on 5 June 1881 at  Shalston Villas, Surbiton Hill,  Surbiton, Surrey to \bioref{John_Hill_Munday} and \bioref{Catherine_Aldridge}, and christened on 27 July 1881 at Christchurch, Surbiton.\cite{NoraMundayBirth} 	She had four siblings: \bioref{Kathleen_Munday}, \bioref{Mildred_Mary_Munday}, \bioref{Ralph_Munday}, and \bioref{Margery_Munday}.

In the years  1891 to 1901 (and beyond) the family lived at The Mendips, Langley Ave., Surbiton \cite{NoraMundayResidence}  Educated at Cheltenham Ladies College, she became an accomplished photographer before her marriage.

She married \bioref{Frederick_Westbrook} on 8 November 1916 at the Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Street, London \cite{NoraMundayMarriage}.  He was an officer in the colonial police, and they first went out to Ghana (then the Gold Coast) on 24 January 1917 on the S.S. Karina, from Liverpool. She was one of the very few white women to do so. She appears on the passenger lists for the Abinsi, (17 July 1917 when she returned to visit her family), the Ekari (5 October 1921) and the Appam (4 February 1923) - with the port of departure being Lagos \cite{NoraMundayTravel}. She travelled up country with her husband and visited areas in which the native population had never seen a white woman before.  They had no children; Nora did not remarry after the early death of her husband, and lived to be 91 (as recorded in notes from her niece, Virginia Grebenik). She lived an independent life in Kensington until her death in September 1972 in Hammersmith, Greater London \cite{NoraMundayDeath}.
