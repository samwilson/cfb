\biohead{Frederick Robert Westbrook}{}{}

Frederick Robert Westbrook was born in 1880 or 1881 in Dartford, Kent.\cite{FrederickWestbrookBirth, FrederickWestbrookDeath} 

He married \bioref{Nora_Katie_Munday} on 8 November 1916 at the Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Street, London. \cite{NoraMundayMarriage}  He was an officer in the colonial police, and he and Nora went out to Ghana (then the Gold Coast). They travelled up country to very remote areas of the country.
As was the case with many colonial administrators, his health was damaged by his service and he retired to settle in Devonshire. They had no children.

He died in early 1927 at the age of 46.\cite{FrederickWestbrookDeath}
