\biohead{Hannah Dando}{}{}

Hannah Dando was born in 1784 in Camerton, Somerset (her father may have been James Bullock Dando, born in 1850 and her mother could have been Ann Evans, born in 1850) and she did have at least one sister, Sarah Dando.  She married \bioref{George_Hill} in 1803 and they had eleven children---however, they lost seven children as infants (who were not all listed in family records).

In 1851, Hannah was a Landed Proprietor, widowed, and was living with her older sister Sarah Dando.\cite{HDandoHome} After George died, she lived in Newhouse, or Hill House as it became known, which with ``their appendages should then be for the use of John Hill for life and then to Thomas Ames Hill and his descendants.'' The property consisted of ``Orchards, Malthouse, Gardens, Stables, Coachhouses, and edifices''. In 1861, she had moved to the Silk House, next door to Hill House.\cite{HDando1861}

She died on 16 April 1862 (of bronchitis) at the Silk House and was buried on 23 April in Paulton churchyard (see page \pageref{George_Hill}) Her daughter in law, Elizabeth Jane, (wife of Thomas Ames) was present at her death.

The details of her Will were as follows: 
``Effects under \pounds 100 6 June the will of Hannah Hill late of Paulton in the county of Somerset Widow deceased who died 16 April 1862 at Paulton aforesaid was proved at Wells by the oath of John Hill of Paulton aforesaid Gentleman the son one of the executors.''

A memorial card, held by a (living) family member read:
``In remembrance of the late Hannah Hill (of Paulton) who died at her residence on Wednesday 16th day of April 1862 aged 78 years and was interred in the Family vault in Paulton Churchyard on Wednesday 23rd day of April 1862.``
