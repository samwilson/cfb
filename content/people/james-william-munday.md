BELL FROM OLD SHIP

BUSSELTON, July 7: A letter received this week by the headmaster of the Busselton State School (Mr. S. G. Demasson) from Mr. H. G, Yelverton, of Quindalup, clears up the mystery as to how a bell from the Norwegian ship Geffrard came to be at the school.

Mr. Yelverton said that the Geffrard was driven ashore about 1875 or 1876 while loading tim ber for Mauritius and became a total wreck. His grandfather, the late Mr. Henry Yelverton, bought all the fittings off the wreck, including the bell, which was placed outside his house office at the Quindalup beach, where it remained for a number of years and was rung to call the men to work and knock off. It was given by Mr. H. G. Yelverton's father, the late Mr. H. J. Yelverton, to the late Mr. G. B. Milne for erection at the Busselton school.

While fishing over a bank about a quarter of a mile north-east of the old Quindalup jetty on a calm day between 1888 and 1900 Mr. W. J. Harwood could still see the remains of the wreck.

This bank is still known to older residents of Quindalup as the Geffrard Bank.
