Frances Heeley was born about 1801 in Birmingham, Warwickshire, to \bioref{Thomas_Heeley} and \bioref{Mary_Heeley} (maiden name unknown).

She married \bioref{Thomas_Elias_Hancox} on 2 May 1830 at St Philips, Birmingham, Warwickshire and they had five children (see page \pageref{Thomas_Elias_Hancox}).

In 1841, Frances is living with her four children, Thomas, William, Harry and Frances at 43 St Bartholomew Street, Birmingham,   and is working as a Brace and Belt Manufacturer  \cite{FrancesHeeleyWork} (there is no mention of her husband on that date).
