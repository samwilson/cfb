\biohead{Mary Ellen Moulsdale}{}{}{A portrait taken in Liverpool.\cite{MEMportrait}}

Mary Ellen Moulsdale was born on 4 April 1845 in Liverpool, Lancashire \cite{MEMoulsdaleBirth} and baptised on 24 April 1845 at St Peters Church, Liverpool, Lancashire \cite{MEMoulsdaleBaptism}. Her parents were \bioref{John_Moulsdale} and \bioref{Maria_Jackson} and she had two sisters: Maria Moulsdale (1857--?) and Sarah Ann Moulsdale (1857--?), presumably twins. 

In 1858 she was attending Miss Hawkin's Seminary in Liverpool, Lancashire \cite{MEMoulsdaleSchool}.

By April 1871`she was living at 19 Breck Road, Walton-in-the-Hill with James Denton (at the time aged 66, a Gentleman) and his wife Mary (aged 62) and her sister Maria \cite{MEMoulsdaleResidence}.  She was by then their adopted daughter \cite{MEMoulsdaleAdoption},  but there are no records of why she should have been adopted beyond some personal records made by her husband. 

She married \bioref{Thomas_Henry_Barker} on 25 August 1875 at St Margarets, in Anfield, Liverpool, Lancashire \cite{MEMoulsdaleMarriage} and they lived at 10 Falkner Street, Liverpool.  They had seven sons: \bioref{James_Denton_Barker}, \bioref{Charles_Frederick_Strangeways_Barker}, Reverend \bioref{Thomas_Percy_Conyers_Barker}, \bioref{Francis_Darcy_Mead_Barker}, \bioref{William_Danby_Holt_Barker}, \bioref{Jonathan_Tong_Barker}, and \bioref{Henry_Bertram_Mitford_Barker}.

She died, aged 91, on 14 December 1936 at 10 Lancaster Avenue, Sefton Park, Merseyside, England \cite{ToxtethBarker20} and the Probate notice read:
``BARKER Mary Ellen of 10 Lancaster Avenue, Sefton Park, Liverpool died 14 December 1936. Probate Liverpool 25 January to James Denton Barker average adjuster. Effects 287 pounds 2 shillings and 4 pence.''

She is buried in the same grave as her husband in Toxteth Park Cemetery, and the inscription reads ``Also of Mary Ellen wife of the above T.H. Barker. Died December 14th 1936 \ae{}tat. 91.''\cite{THBgrave}
