\biohead{Henry Bertram Mitford Barker}{}{}

Henry (known as Harry) was born on 8 March 1886 in Liverpool,\cite{HBMBarkerBirth} to \bioref{Thomas_Henry_Barker} and \bioref{Mary_Ellen_Moulsdale}\cite{HBMBarkerBirth}. He had six brothers: \bioref{James_Denton_Barker}, Charles Frederick Strangways Barker \bioref{Charles_Frederick_Strangeways_Barker}, Thomas Percy Conyers Barker \bioref{Thomas_Percy_Conyers_Barker}, Francis Darcy Mead Barker \bioref{Francis_Darcy_Mead_Barker}, William Danby Holt Barker \bioref{William_Danby_Holt_Barker}, and Jonathan Tong Barker \bioref{Jonathan_Tong_Barker}.

He was educated at Liverpool College (1905--1916) and lived with his family at ``Ormesby'', West Kirby, Cheshire.  At the outbreak of World War One, he was employed as a grain merchant.  He then joined the army as a lance corporal in the Yeoman Infantry and  was part of the British Expeditionary Force, France from 1 November 1914 to 20 April 1916. During this time, on 15 June 1915, he was wounded and briefly out of service (due to `myalgia', or muscle pain) but returned to service after just a week.\cite{HBMBarkerCasualtyForm}

He was promoted to Corporal on 21 February 1916.\cite{HBMBarkerCasualtyForm}

He was transferred and promoted to Second Lieutenant with the 3/9th King's Liverpool Regiment on 22 April 1916 and returned to France. 

He was wounded again on 31 July 1917 at Ypres, and admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital on 10 August 1917, where he  was subsequently listed as `unfit for service'.

A letter he wrote later that year reads as follows:\cite{HBMBarkerWarrecord}
