\biohead{Maria Mary Merrett}{}{}

Maria Mary Merrett was born in Stroud, Gloucestershire in (about) 1845 to \bioref{James_Merrett} and \bioref{Elizabeth_Coppin}.
She had  six siblings: William Merrett (c.~1842--?), Elizabeth Sarah Merrett (c.~1843--?), Catherine M. Merrett (c.~1848--?), Lucy Merrett (1852--1926), Richard H. Merrett (c.~1853--?), and Charlotte Merrett (c.~1857--?).

She married \bioref{Harry_Hancox} on 28 May 1867 at St Stephen the Martyr, West Derby, Lancashire \cite{MariaMerrettMarriage} and her sister Catherine was a witness.
They had four sons (see page \pageref{Harry_Hancox}).

In the 1891 Census, Maria Mary was a widow and living at 30 Edge Lane. Her occupation was given as "Living on her own means" and she had her four sons at home: Harry was 22 (Bankers clerk), Frank was 21 (student of medicine), Charles was 19 (merchants clerk) and Richard was 17 (bankers junior clerk) \cite{MariaMerrettOccupation})

In 1901, she was 55, and had three of her four sons still living at home: Harry was 32 (a bankers clerk), Charles was 29 (office manager) and Richard was 29 (a bankers clerk); their address was 30 Edge Lane, Liverpool \cite{MariaMerrettResidence}.

She died on 22 October 1908 and was buried at Toxteth Park Cemetery on 24 October. \cite{MariaMerrettDeath}
