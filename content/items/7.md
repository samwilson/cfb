My dear Mrs Munday,

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of 2 letters from you dated Jan/76 I was anxious to hear how yourself and Mr Munday were after hearing the sad news of dear James's death I am sure you must all have felt the flow severely time alone can heal the wounds our hearts have recieved in the death of our dear ones I pray God to help us all to be resigned to his will in his own good time

I went to see the grave yesterday some of the flowers are in bloom. I have not put many on just yet till the weather gets cooler we got some of the letters you sent to James he expected some at Adelaide but when he enquired for them they had been sent on to WA so they may be sent back to you or come to us or be destroyed after a time. you ask {?} James come by steamer from {?} yes to Freemantle and had to stay there a long time settling {?} ships {?} Mr Davis behaved very bad to him there was an inquest about the wreck but James was absolved from all blame.

Then Mr D {?} the accounts and at last it was settled by arbitration James gaining the day each paying their own expenses which were very heavy all this time his health was bad and under a {?} stopping at an hotel we know there in not much comfort in those places then he thought he would {?} there for a while but got worse sent me a letter to say he was coming home to comfort me little thinking I should have to be his comforter he started from there in the Brig Cleopatra bound for Adelaide he was very had all the way the Capt told one he was very glad to get to A he had 3 Doctors there who advised him to get home to his friends and go under Doctor {?} who they thought would be able to understand his complaint and do him good if any one could so he came by steamer from there telegraphing to us to meet him with a cab as he could not walk his breathing was so bad if he got at all excited he was only home 3 weeks to the day when he died

I shall gladly keep the the {?} of your self {?} dear Alice had them framed directly she got them thinking the would keep best that way and left them under my care I shewed them to James one day he seemed pleased with them

Mr Cook has not been very well lately suffering from pains in his chest am glad to say I feel better now. had to go away for a change as I could not get my back right at all so took a trip {?} to Camperdown where James and Alice went on their wedding trip to see some old friends of ours as their eldest-Daughter was to be married the beginning of this month and I so dreaded the aneversry of Alice's death that I was thankful to have something to invest my thoughts for a time for when I am alone they are always in my thoughts in some way or the other and yet I try to bear with one thing I have no unpleasant memories of either for no angry or unkind words ever passed between us they where both very thoughtful and kind to me in every way I forgot to tell you before that the same minester that married them read the funeral service for James I was sorry he could not come to see him but our house was to far for him and he was very busy in his own Parish just then almost the first day he was at home he said as soon as I am well enough mother we must go to St Marys and hear Mr Potter again he always used to go with us when ever he was in port) we will have some fresh Photos taken also some of the grave and send them when we send the box I was in hopes to have had it away before this but not being very well and so busy with one thing and another has delayed us Mr Cook desires his kind regards to Mr M and yourself in which I heartily join believe me yours {?} F Cook
