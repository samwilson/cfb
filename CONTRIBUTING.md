Guidelines for contributing to this project
===========================================

## Style guide

People's names should be followed by parentheses containing either
1. a page reference (if the person is in the book); or
2. the person's birth and death dates (if they're not).

## LaTeX shortcuts

Biography headers:

	\biohead{Full Name}{Name, Full}{Photo caption; if non-empty a portrait will be displayed.}

Biography references (to people's names):

	\bioref{Person_File_Name}

Index entries (plain; for more complicated ones do the usual, e.g. `\index{Surname, First}`):

	\idx{text to both display and index}

Full stops that are not sentence-ending should be marked e.g. `F.E.\@Wellows`

## Tree (SVG) conventions

Names in 11pt, dates 9pt; all `serif`.

Indent continued-line names with three spaces.
